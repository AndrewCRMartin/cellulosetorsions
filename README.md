=================

This is a simple program based loosely on `pdbtorsions` from
`BiopTools` for calculating torsion angles and their distributions in
cellulose.

Building the code
-----------------

You need to download and install `BiopLib`. You can then just type
`make` to build the program.

Running the program
-------------------

Simply type `./cellulosetorsions -h` for help.
